## 🎯 What is arc42?

arc42 is the proven, open-source template for software architecture documentation created by Dr. Gernot Starke and Dr. Peter Hruschka. Used in thousands of projects worldwide, it provides a pragmatic, tool-agnostic approach to documenting software architectures.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Document economically but continuously
- "Painless documentation" - only what stakeholders truly need
- All sections are optional - use what fits your project
- Suitable for agile and traditional environments

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Claude Code Users

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MSicc/awesome-arc42-copilot.git
   ```

2. **Choose your section** (e.g., Section 1: Introduction and Goals)
   - Open `prompts/arc42-section-01-prompt.md`
   - Read the input template
   - Fill in your project details

3. **Let your AI assistant generate the documentation**
   - Copy the prompt into your AI coding assistant
   - Provide your project-specific information
   - Review and refine the generated output

### Example Workflow

```markdown
1. Read: instructions/arc42-section-01-instructions.md
   → Understand what Section 1 should contain

2. Use: prompts/arc42-section-01-prompt.md
   → Generate documentation with your AI assistant

3. Review and refine the generated output
   → Iterate with your AI assistant until satisfied
```

**Note:** The `quality/REVIEW-PROMPT.md` is for maintainers to validate the instruction and prompt files themselves, not for reviewing your generated documentation.

## ⚠️ How This Project Was Created

This repository is itself a demonstration of AI-assisted technical writing. The instructions and prompts were created through an iterative collaboration between a human architect (Marco) and Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant).

### Creation Process:

1. **Research Phase** - Extensive review of official arc42 sources (arc42.org, docs.arc42.org, quality.arc42.org, faq.arc42.org)
2. **Instruction Development** - Section-by-section creation of comprehensive guidelines based on official arc42 standards
3. **LLM Optimization** - Crafting prompts specifically designed for AI coding assistants
4. **Quality Assurance** - Systematic review against arc42 standards using a structured validation protocol
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Multiple review cycles to ensure accuracy and completeness

### Key Principles:

- ✅ **Authenticity First** - All content based on official arc42 sources, not invented
- ✅ **Standards Compliance** - Validated against docs.arc42.org and quality.arc42.org
- ✅ **Human Oversight** - Human architect provided direction, requirements, and validation
- ✅ **AI Efficiency** - AI assistant handled research, synthesis, and structured content creation
- ✅ **Systematic Quality** - Built-in review protocol ensures ongoing accuracy

This collaboration model demonstrates how AI can accelerate documentation work while maintaining professional standards - exactly what this repository enables for architecture documentation.

### Transparency Note:

We believe in transparency about AI involvement in content creation. This repository was:
- **Researched** by AI from authoritative arc42 sources
- **Structured** by AI following arc42 methodology
- **Directed** by human expertise in software architecture
- **Validated** through systematic quality reviews
- **Maintained** with ongoing human oversight

The result is production-ready content that respects the original arc42 creators' work while making it more accessible through modern AI tools.

### Phase 1: Quality Refinement (In Progress)
**Goal:** Incorporate improvements identified during systematic quality reviews

- 🔄 **Refine Instructions** - Address findings from section-by-section validation
- 🔄 **Enhance Prompts** - Improve LLM effectiveness based on review feedback
- 🔄 **Update Examples** - Add more concrete, real-world examples
- 🔄 **Cross-Section Consistency** - Ensure perfect alignment between related sections

### Phase 2: Real-World Validation (Next)
**Goal:** Battle-test the system on an actual project

- 📋 **Use Case: persona-template MCP Server**
